420-411-VA W24 Assignment 2

My apologies for the very messy code. 

I will try to add some info here on the various issues I faced, open questions/issues, and what is still to be done:
- Creating comments is not yet implemented.
- Creating publications is bugged, the App resolve() method is returning the wrong method. Unclear why.
- I found the whole thing difficult to organize. I think the models are alright, while the controllers and views are not so great.
- Speaking of controllers, I struggled to define appropriate controllers and determine which operations should go where, as well as their routes. I am also unsure when I should use the various methods of passing data between pages/parts of the application.
